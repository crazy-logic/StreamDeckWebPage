# StreamDeckWebPage
A webpage that uses WebHID to receive button presses from a Stream Desk. 

## Why and where i've got to...
This project started as a method to quickly see how a Stream Deck works - with the end goal of making an Open Source Arduino. So far, I have managed to program an Arduino to appear as a Stream Deck in terms of it's HID vendor and product ID's, but now I need the reports to exist also. Work in progress.
